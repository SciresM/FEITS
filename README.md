# V1.2 Changelog

-Localized the names to fit the official names Nintendo of America gave the international version of Fire Emblem Fates.

-Added Fire Emblem Awakening and Fire Emblem Fates' font, Chiaro Std B Bold, to the resources folder, so it may be used in the future for text instead of the PNG.


==  Things that still need to be done  ==

-Velouria should be put in her correct place in the portrait generator, and named properly. There are two extra Kanas in the list with Japanese names, for some reason.

-Rename the simulator to "FEFTS" or something similar, to fit with the English name of the game.

-See if the font can be used for the generated text instead of the PNG.
