# FEFTS
Fire Emblem Fates Text Simulator


Forked from https://github.com/SciresM/FEITS .
Credit to SciresM for the original program. I only localized the names and fixed a few things.

Simulates Fire Emblem Fates conversations, allows for the generation of portraits with specific hair colors, and is generally neat.

== Things that still need to be done ==

- See if the font can be used for the generated text instead of the PNG, for higher-resolution images.

- Implement DLC portraits. Portraits, along with FaceData.bin files, are located in FEFTS\Resources\img\Not_Yet_Used\.
